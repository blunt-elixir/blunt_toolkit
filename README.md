# Commanded Toolkit

`threequarterspi` over on Slack asked if anyone had implemented some sort of time-traveling for `Commanded`. 

I immediately thought of the `redux devtools` and thought that would be pretty cool for viewing aggregate state over time...with real data.

So I set out to get a bit of something working. 

After discovering and digging a bit into [ratatouille](ndreynolds/ratatouille), I was able to get that little something.
